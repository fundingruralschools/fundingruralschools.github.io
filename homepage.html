    <div class="secureruralschoolsexp">
        <h2>Following the creation of the United States Forest Service in 1905,
        the Act of May 23, 1908--today, known as the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act.
        This act was meant to help compensate counties with growing amounts of forest service land for the potential tax
        money which they were losing by not building on the acres of protected land.Payments to counties are broken into
        three categories: Title I for roads and schools, Title II for projects on federal lands, and Title III for county projects.</h2>

        <h2>Case studies are reported from the year 2024. Looking at the three counties that received the most funding from the Secure Rural Schools program, 
            we found that they all have a lower household income, significantly below Californiaâ€™s state average of $96,334. Lower incomes mean families may 
            struggle with educational costs, and schools in these counties rely heavily on federal programs like Secure Rural Schools to fund essential services.  </h2>

            <p>This website was made as a project for the class "Building News Applications",
                taught by Stanford University Lorry I. Lokey Visiting Professor in Professional Journalism
                Serdar Tumgoren. Website creators Lee Xiong '25 and Charlotte Burks '27 settled on reporting
                on the Secure Rural Schools Program through a shared interest in public education reporting,
                and built this website over ten weeks, starting with no web design experience. Xiong focused
                primarily on data analysis, and designed the data visualization for the site, while Burks 
                focused on front-end development.

                I'm passionate about using data to solve social issues, as it holds so much valuable insights.

            <p class="charliebio">Hi! I'm Charlie, a sophomore majoring in Classics at Stanford.
                Aside from my interests in ancient history and language, I hope to pursue a career in journalism. My past 
                reporting has dealt with art and education, and I am currently the Stanford Daily news section's beat reporter 
                covering graduate and international students. This website is my first experiencing in coding, and 
                I've spent the past ten weeks learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript for it.
